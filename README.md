# 🔥 **APK Payload Injector Script** 🔥

Welcome to the **APK Payload Injector Script**, designed for penetration testers, ethical hackers, and security enthusiasts! This script allows you to inject a **Meterpreter Reverse TCP Payload** into an Android APK file for testing the security of Android applications. With its improved version, this script ensures better functionality, ease of use, and a seamless experience.

### 📌 **Features:**
- 🛠 **Payload Injection**: Seamlessly injects a reverse TCP Meterpreter payload into your APK file.
- ✅ **Root Privilege Check**: Ensures the script is executed with root privileges for smooth operation.
- 💻 **Metasploit Integration**: Automatically configures and runs Metasploit to handle the payload listener.
- 🖥 **Web Server Hosting**: Uses Apache2 to host the modified APK for easy download.
- 🛡 **APK Signing**: Automatically signs the APK to ensure it's valid for installation.
- 📂 **Backup Creation**: Makes a backup of your original APK for safety.
- 🚀 **Improved Error Handling**: More reliable with clear error messages and logging.
- 📝 **Log File Generation**: Logs every step and output into a detailed log file for troubleshooting.
- 🔒 **Security Enhancements**: Ensures the APK is signed and ready for deployment with additional validation.

### ⚙️ **How It Works:**
1. **Check for Root**: The script checks if you’re running as root (admin). It will exit if you're not.
2. **Install Required Packages**: Automatically installs necessary tools like **Metasploit**, **APKTool**, **Apache2**, and more.
3. **Inject Payload**: Uses **msfvenom** to inject a Meterpreter payload into the APK.
4. **APK Signing**: If the APK is not signed, it automatically signs the APK using the provided private key and certificate.
5. **Web Hosting**: The modified APK is served using Apache2 on your local machine (LHOST).
6. **Metasploit Handler**: The script starts the **Metasploit** handler to listen for incoming connections from the payload.

### 🛠 **Installation Guide**:

#### **Step 1: Install Dependencies** (Ensure you're on a Linux-based OS)
Run the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
sudo apt install metasploit-framework wget default-jdk aapt apksigner apache2 unzip curl




chmod +x 3xpl0it
sudo ./3xpl0it



⚡ Usage Guide:
Set up the LHOST and LPORT:

When prompted, enter the IP address of your machine (LHOST) and the port (LPORT) for Metasploit to listen on.

Choose APK File:

Select the APK file you wish to inject the payload into.

Final Result:

The modified APK will be served via a local web server (Apache2) at http://<LHOST>/<BIND_APK_NAME>.

Metasploit Handler:

The script automatically starts Metasploit’s multi/handler to capture the reverse connection.

📝 Important Notes:
🚨 Ethical Use Only: This script is for educational purposes only. Always ensure you have explicit permission before testing any application or device.

💻 Run as Root: The script requires root access to install necessary dependencies and modify system files.

🔄 Backup Your APK: Always make a backup of your original APK to avoid losing the original file.

📂 Directory Structure:
payload_injection_log.txt - Logs all actions and errors during execution for troubleshooting.

/var/www/html/ - Where the modified APK is stored for web serving.

📚 What’s New in Version 2.0?
✨ Improved Logging: Every action is logged into a payload_injection_log.txt file.

🛠 APK Signing: Automatically signs the APK if it’s not already signed.

🔧 Root Check: Checks for root access before running, making the script more secure.

🧰 Enhanced Error Handling: If anything fails, you get a clear error message with suggestions.

🔄 Automatic Updates: The script automatically installs missing dependencies.

💡 Troubleshooting:
APK Signing Issues: Make sure you have the necessary private key and certificate for signing the APK.

Web Hosting Not Working: Ensure Apache2 is installed and running correctly. You can check it using sudo service apache2 status.

🔐 Security Notice:
This script is designed with security in mind, but it's still essential to:

Use the payload only on systems you have explicit authorization to test.

Be aware of legal constraints and ethical hacking practices when performing penetration testing.
